# *ACL Paper Styles

This directory contains the latest LaTeX and Word templates for *ACL
conferences.

To adapt them for your conference, please fork this repository and
make necessary changes. Minimally, you'll need to update the name of
the conference and rename the files.

If you make improvements to the templates that should be propagated to
future conferences, please submit a pull request. Thank you in
advance!

In older versions of the templates, authors were asked to fill in the
START submission ID so that it would be stamped at the top of each
page of the anonymized version. This is no longer needed, because it
is now possible to do this stamping automatically within
START. Currently, the way to do this is for the program chair to email
support@softconf.com and request it.

## Issues

- Mixing of cm and in.  Do we want this to all be cm?
- Missing example of a figure.
- No mention of Equation formatting (Sec. 3.10 in Word doc).
